どうぞよろしく! It's nice to meet you! I recently switched careers away from engineering in the Semiconductor field! I have several years of research experience; focusing on solar panel and semiconductor design; ranging from the
operation and collection of data. To analysis, presentation, and publication! I recently have made a switch to software development and now I'm aiming to strengthen my research abilities with modelling and simulations!
