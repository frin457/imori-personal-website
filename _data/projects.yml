#If you have worked on relevant projects talk about them here

- name: CIGs solar panel
  description: Copper Indium Gallium DiSelenide (CIGs) solar panels are a thin solar solution that; over the last decade; has seen significant increases in effeciency, with steady decreases in manufacturing costs. I was fortunate enough to get elbow deep into CIGs characterization during my undergraduate studies at SUNY POLY, with the E2TAC research team!
  
- name: Design evaluation
  description: As technology ever advances it's imperative to stay up to date on new developments. However, it is equally important to review designs and determine areas of improvement. I often review new technologies and, through discussion with my peers, evaluate how effective or efficient the design is. The topic often varies, but common topics include semiconductor fabrication techniques, game design, and DIY projects!

- name: Simulation and AI
  description: In step with my other interests, I follow publications on AI techniques and fluid simulation advances. I consider both technologies to be tools I have yet to master, but the usefullness of each cannot be overstated! I often marvel at the simplicity of some newer implementaion techniques for both technologies.

- name: Developing myself as a developer
  description: I believe that there is much to gain by studying the solutions, workflows, standards, and even the thought processes of varying disciplines. In taking a leap away from my background towards software development. I hope to climb higher and provide a new perspective to the problems of both professions... and any others that I may cross paths with!
